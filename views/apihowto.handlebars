<h2>Steam's APIs</h2>

<p>
This page will be an introduction to some of Steam's API's that I find interesting. In this introduction, we 
will discuss how to implement the Steam's API and then show some API examples. It will end with combining two
APIs to form a webpage that will show you which games you own and if there are any current updates.

	<h2>Setup - How to get the API setup</h2>
	<h3>First Step - Creating API key</h3>
	<div>
		To use Steam's API, we need to first get an access key so our JavaScript can access it. Here are the steps needed to
		create a Steam API key:
	</div>
	<div>
		1) Goto: <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/login/home/?goto=%2Fdev%2Fapikey" target="_blank">
			https://steamcommunity.com/login/home/?goto=%2Fdev%2Fapikey
	</a>
	</div>
	<div>
		2) You will see a login screen. Login to your steam account or create a new steam user account
	</div>

	<div>
		3) You will then have to enter in your domain name. I entered in the IP address of my server for an example. You
		will have to agree to their terms and then click on 'Register'.
	</div>

	<div>
		4) You will then be presented with your API key. Mine is presented below. Make sure to copy it and save it
		to a place for reference. I like to use OneNote so its always backed up.
	</div>

		Congratulations! You now have a web API key for Steam. Now, lets take a look at using it with one of their API's
		called 'GetOwned Games'
	</div>

<section id="FindUserID">
	<h2>Setup - Find your steam ID</h2>
	<div>
		Some API's require a stream ID. Its very easy to find your stream ID. To do this, login to your stream profile
		 here: http://steamcommunity.com/. Once you are loged in, click on your profile pic in the upper right corner
		 and it will take you to your profile. Your stream ID is the long number located in the URL after profiles/. 
		 Copy it to a safe location so you can use it later.
